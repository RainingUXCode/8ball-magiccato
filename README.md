# 🐾 8-Ball Magicatto

**Magicatto** is a fun and interactive web project inspired by the classic _Magic 8-Ball_ toy — but with a cute twist!  
Instead of a black ball, a mage cat represents the mystical oracle that gives you random answers to your yes-or-no questions.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project was inspired by the **JavaScript Magic 8-Ball exercise** from [Codédex](https://www.codedex.io/).  
The button design was based on this layout from [Uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io/Ashon-G/afraid-lion-76) by _Ashon-G_.<br>
The cat illustration used in the interface was **drawn by me**, giving the project a personal and unique touch. 🎨

Magicatto reimagines the 8-ball as a cute cat for a cozy, playful experience — perfect for fun web experiments or beginner-friendly coding practice.
